    "This app has to be installed and used together with the **[Collabora Online](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/richdocuments)** app.\n\nCollabora Online is a powerful LibreOffice-based online office suite with collaborative editing, which supports all major documents, spreadsheet and presentation file formats and works together with all modern browsers.\n\nThis app provides a built-in server with all of the document editing features of Collabora Online. Easy to install, for personal use or for small teams. A bit slower than a standalone server and without the advanced scalability features.\n\nThe download is rather big so it is possible you experience a time-out when using the web interface. You can use the OCC command line tool to install the built-in server:\n\n```\nsudo -u wwwrun php -d memory_limit=512M ./occ app:install richdocumentscode\n```\nWhere `wwwrun` is the user of your web server. This is ```www-data``` on Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives, `wwwrun` on SUSE based distributions, `apache` on Red Hat/Fedora and `http` on Arch linux and derivatives.\n\nUpdates can be done like this:\n```\nsudo -u wwwrun php -d memory_limit=512M ./occ app:update --all\n```\n\nOf course, alternatively you could increase memory usage and PHP time-outs by default, see the [Nextcloud documentation.](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/big_file_upload_configuration.html?highlight=php%20timeout#configuring-your-web-server)" : "This app has to be installed and used together with the **[Collabora Online](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/richdocuments)** app.\n\nCollabora Online is a powerful LibreOffice-based online office suite with collaborative editing, which supports all major documents, spreadsheet and presentation file formats and works together with all modern browsers.\n\nThis app provides a built-in server with all of the document editing features of Collabora Online.
